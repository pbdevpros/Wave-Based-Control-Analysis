THIS IS THE SUPPLEMENTARY CODE FOR THE BACHELOR'S THESIS PROJECT BY PADRAIG BASQUEL

"Control of Flexible Systems: An Analysis of the Performance of Wave-Based Control"

APRIL 2017

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FOLDERS IN THIS DRIVE ARE USED FOR:

Acceleration Limited Time Optimal Control - Find time optimal control rest-to-rest times & 1% and 2% times.

Acceleration Limited Wave-Based Response - Find the Wave-Based Control 1% & 2% settling times for a system using a preamplifier, P.

GUI - Graphical User Interface with tools to analyse systems using WBC

ITSE- Wave-domain & s-domain - Calculate the ITSE of transfer functions in the wave and s-domain

Optimisation - ITSE - File used to calculate the optimal transfer function coefficients for ISE, ITSE, IT2SE

Rational Approximation - Used to calculate a rational approximation for a given wave-based controller
